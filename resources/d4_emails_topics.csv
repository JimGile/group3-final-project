Ron,6864 East Bucknell Place,ron@email.com,0,2024-08-05,The lack of police presence and code enforcement is sending a growing message that these violations are not important…and that reckless behavior is not of great concern. Second item: affordable denver and wanting more information about how the tax will accomplish the goals set by Mayor. ,"Good morning Ron, 

Thank you for reaching out, and I apologize for the delayed response. Council Pro Tem Romero Campbell maintains regular communication with DPD District 3, which serves Southeast Denver. We have a strong relationship with Commander Bell and Chief Thomas, consistently supporting DPD's resource and policy needs. With budget season approaching, we carefully consider input from our officers during council votes.
We also attend monthly community advisory board meetings to address concerns. For more details on DPD’s recruitment and specific traffic enforcement, I recommend reaching out to them directly at 3.Dist@denvergov.org.
Regarding the Mayor’s affordable housing tax initiative, we supported sending it to the ballot for Denver residents to vote on in November. For more information, you can contact the Mayor's office at 720-865-9000 or visit their website. Thank you.

Also is there aywya that a turn signal could be implemented at Hampden and Dahlia? ,"Thank you for reaching out to our office.  The area engineers have looked at this intersection where the High Line Canal crosses Dahlia multiple times at our request and have determined that a flashing signal is not warranted at this location.  However, they are looking at better signage and clearer striping for this crossing.  Councilwoman Romero Campbell will continue to advocate for this in her quarterly meetings with the area engineers.

Please report the overgrown vegetation to 311.  By reporting this online the case will be reviewed by Forestry and put on the list for a trimming if necessary.

The intersection at Dahlia and Happy Canyon is being studied by Denver's Department of Infrastructure and Transportation (DOTI) and the Colorado Department of Transportation (because Hampden is a State Highway).  This is a complicated and expensive intersection to make safer and there is not funding committed for this project.  However, your feedback is important for Councilwoman Romero Campbell to continue to advocate for safety improvement  at this location.  ",Staff2,,,Transit

Unfortunately, it is not possible for you to pick up a compost bin.  Solid Waste is rolling out weekly compost service district by district, focusing on helping customers understand what items to place in their newly delivered green carts.  The department is prioritizing neighborhoods with lower diversion rates in its rollout, with SWC Districts 5, 8  and 3 next in line in 2024, we are in SWC District 9, and will receive our bins in 2025.   Residents will continue to receive a credit on their invoice until compost service starts in their neighborhood.  I am sorry you had a bad experience with Solid Waste.   Your feed back is important to  Councilwoman Romero Campbell when advocating with Solid Waste for better communication and transparency regarding the compost bin roll out. 
Councilwoman Romero Campbell is also advocating for a new and larger recreation center for southeast Denver.  This process takes years to accomplish but raising awareness of the need is the first step.
The small Hawthorn trees on the Quincy/Yosemite medians are on the list to be removed but are not considered a priority as there is a low chance they will fail  (Forestry talk for fall over) or impact the Right Of Way.
The weeds on the median are scheduled to be cut mid-September.

Pauline,,pauline@email.com,0,2024-08-21,"At any rate my concern is how will HOA condo units be charges? $150.00 per unit per year so a 200 unit building would pay $40,000 additional on storm water bill.  I look forward to clarification on this in District 4 scoop newletters as we have budgets to be made. Between sidewalk fee (with CPI every year), wage increase, possible sales tax increase, general inflation and new rules and regs we middle class folks are on the losing end.  Especially the seniors. Where is the ‘lookup tool” that was mentioned?","Good afternoon Pauline, 

Thank you for reaching out to our office. As you know the sidewalk fee in November 2022, a citizen-led ballot initiative passed by voters directed Denver's Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (DOTI) to build out, reconstruct, and repair the sidewalk network on behalf of the citizens of Denver. 
Since that time, DOTI has been working with a citizen task force to review and update the ordinance to develop a clear path forward to deliver the sidewalk improvements in a timely and affordable manner. Task force recommendations around a new citywide sidewalk fee structure are being made now to Denver City Council; more information can be found here.
Once solidified, the sidewalk fee structure will be posted on the DOTI website. Denver property owners can expect to see a Sidewalk Fee on their Stormwater bill as early as January 2025.
The example you gave could be dependent on whether each unit has access to a sidewalk directly (e.g are the units stacked), is there an HOA involved, overall sqft of the sidewalks around the entire property. DOTI will be presenting to the City council very soon regarding the sidewalk fee and we will get a better understanding on the fee structure. Until then, we will be keep recording questions we receive from constituents and share those with DOTI. Once we get an update, we will share it in the newsletter.

Debbie,4504 S Yosemite St #361 ,debbie@email.com,0,2024-08-21,"What actions if any is the City contemplating on making the downtown Denver the safe environment it was for so many years? I hear the Mayor talking about revitalizing downtown but have not seen any specifics on how he plans to make this a safe place for all of us to enjoy? The second part of my question is if the City is serious about revitalizing downtown Denver is that not a direct contradiction with the pending approval of that huge development proposed at the corner of East 1st Avenue and University Blvd which will suck more people out of downtown Denver and create a major issue for the Cherry Creek area? To me it appears we are shooting ourselves in the foot on this one. We want to revitalize downtown and yet our actions do not support that effort. As a former resident of Cherry Creek, I loved the environment, but the traffic ultimately made me move out in 2006. And now the traffic is even worse, and we will exacerbate the problem even more if the City approves the proposed development.","Thank you for reaching out to our office with your follow up questions from the HOA meeting.  The Mayor is working with the Downtown Denver Partnership to revitalize the 16th Street Mall with the intention to lure more businesses downtown and making it more friendly for people to visit.  You can see the plans here at the project page,  While there is still construction going on I urge you to plan a visit someday and see for yourselves the improvements.  The Denver Police Department has focused many of their resources on the downtown area in order to make people feel safe when visiting and the crime rate for Denver is down from previous years and continuing to trend in that direction.  The DPD has a live Crime Dashboard that you can look up the crime rates and types of crimes in neighborhoods all over the city.  

As for the Cherry Creek area, the developers and the Mayor's office believe that Denver can support both downtown and the Cherry Creek area.  I grew up going to the old walking mall and the shops on 3rd Ave, and my daughter was born the year the new mall opened.  I am excited to see this new development and see it as an asset for future generations of Denverites and visitors.

•	For loud street gatherings after curfew please call the police non-emergency number at 720-913-2000.  The police will try and respond as quickly as they can based on the other cases they are responding to.  
•	If you see criminal or dangerous activity, please call 911 to report it.
•	Finally, I would be happy to connect your HOA with our one of our Community Resource officers in police District 3.  Many times they can offer some other tools for dealing with your situation.

I will check with our Denver Police District 3 team to see if they are aware in any uptick of criminal activity in the area but for the most part crime is down all over the city.

Margaret,Syracuse Plaza,margaret@email.com,0,2024-09-11,Hello my name is Margaret Henry and I live at Syracuse plaza on the corner of Syracuse and Quincy.

Thank you for reaching out to our office. Andrew no longer works in our office however I am able to answer your question. The crosswalk and traffic light proposed to be installed at Syracuse and Quincy was approved by the department of transportation and infrastructure and the project is scheduled to begin construction in 2025. We continue to check in with the department quarterly and will send out updates as more information become available. Thank you.",Staff1,,,Transit
Barbara,Bradley School Zone,barbara@email.com,0,2024-09-12,I am highly concerned that the Bradley International School Zone signs on S Dahlia are frequently not noticed. The north bound 20 mile limit sign is behind a tree limb. I walk along S Dahlia and have witnessed vehicles exceeding the speed limits. It is very congested between 7:30 and 8 a.m. Many parents park on Dahlia and do not always use the crosswalk. Lots of kids walk to school in this neighborhood and cross S Dahlia. I would like to see  'flashing' school zone signs added to ensure the safety of all. Please look into this before there is an accident. ,"DOTI Response: I looked at the school location with the context you provided, and have a few comments/questions, below:
Can you confirm the location of the sign that you’re referring to or do you have an up-to-date photo you can share of this sign?
My assumed location of the sign via Google Streetview: https://www.google.com/maps/@39.6618723,-104.9316874,3a,75y,14.65h,72.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syp1tXf3eLCnXD6ju2DV0CA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D
If you can provide an image of the sign’s obstruction, I can file a 311 case in this instance and have it sent to the City Forester’s Office, which is under Denver Parks and Recreation (DPR).  DPR inspects trees that obstruct signs and can decide whose responsibility it is to trim the foliage. 
I also encourage you to file a 311 case (by dialing 311 on your phone, or visiting the link here to submit online), so that DPR might be able to connect with you regarding any questions they might have related to the request. 
                                                               i.      If you would prefer not to file a case, though, again, I’m happy to file the case myself, I just might not have all the context for DPR to best assist, but I’ll do my best.

DOTI has changed their internal process and procedure on how we review the need for school zone flashing beacons to be more proactive for the installation of these assets.  Currently, Bradley International does not meet the eligibility criteria for a school zone flashing beacon. DOTI looks to understand two things:
                                                               i.      Is the school located along a roadway that has a speed limit of at least 30 miles an hour or greater (excluding any school zone speed limit reductions)?
Answer: Yes. 
                                                             ii.      Is the school adjacent to a signalized collector- or arterial- classified roadway?
Answer: No.  While Dahlia Street is classified as a collector roadway, it is not a traffic-signal controlled corridor near the school location.  The technology we use currently use requires a nearby traffic signal to be able to activate the beacon during the enforcement times (during school arrival/dismissal).  There is no traffic signal close enough nearby that would allow DOTI to reliably operate a school zone flashing beacon at this location.
                                                           iii.      If our technology changes, DOTI will proactively reassess our eligibility criteria for school zone flashing beacons to determine if Bradley International becomes eligible.  Please note: alongside our eligibility criteria, DOTI also has a prioritization process to determine where school zone flashing beacons are of a high priority for installation.  If Bradley International becomes eligible, we will also make sure the school is prioritized appropriately and addressed with the limited funding we have for this work year-over-year.

Denver Police is responsible for educating, encouraging, and enforcing traffic laws in Denver.  For concerns related to speeding, DOTI recommends you connect with your local DPD Police Precinct to inquire if they have capacity to support with their staff during arrival/dismissal at the school. 
Local DPD Precinct is 3: Link
You’ll want to engage the Precinct’s Community Resource Officers if you haven’t already.  They can help determine who in their office would be best to assist.
You can also request a DPD Speed Trailer to be deployed if it is available through the DPD Neighborhood Enforcement Team (NET): 720-337-1030.",Staff1,,,"Neighborhood,Parks,Transit,Vehicle"

You are doing more harm than good.  Also, you are making Denver increasingly more expensive for those who live here.

Thank you for reaching out to our office. The issue at Bible park is a matter that DPD and DPR continue to investigate and monitor. CPT Romero Campbell checks in regularly with Commander Bell to make him aware of the issues as well as many more around the district. The Tamarac Shelter and the incidents at Bible are not related as our district had these same issues at Bible last year all summer and the shelter opened in December. 

CPT Romero Campbell voted in favor of all tax initiatives to be proposed to the residents of Denver on the November ballot to give them an opportunity to voice their stance on the affordable housing initiative and the Denver Health tax initiative. CPT Romero Campbell has spent her first year in office listening to the residents and will continue to do so as she represents District 4 at the city council. Let us know if you have further questions. ",Staff1,"
CPT Romero Campbell does not care about her district.  She does not listen to the people who vote and pay taxes.  The shelter should never have been here in the first people.  I talk with a lot of my neighbors and we are upset with her, the mayor and how Denver is going downhill.  She should not have voted for those initiatives.   I know I will vote no.  If passed, did she take into consideration how it affects the residents of Denver? This will raise the sales tax to over 10%.  I can go to other places where the taxes are lower.  However, some cannot.   There are a lot of us barely getting by and this will make it harder on some of us.   I work hard for my money.  Denver taxes us, squanders the money and makes Denver worse.   Has she thought about that?  I don’t know anyone who sees any benefit to these so called initiatives.  I am very upset that we are not being listen to.  In addition, what she doing about the illegal immigrants doing the window washing on the southeast corner of Tamarac and Hampden?  This is illegal and a safety issue.  I did call the police once about it.  I drove by the other day.  One of them just walked in front my car without any concern of the rules of the road or his safety.  I stopped because I did not want to hurt anyone. Others may not. I don’t think they understand the rules of the road here.","Good morning Jennifer,

Thank you for sharing your sentiments with our office. We will strive to continue to improve our avenues of listening to district 4 residents on the issue of taxation in Denver. DPD has been made aware of the newcomers at the intersection of Hampden and Tamarac and they continue to encourage residents to reports cases of harassment and property damage. They patrol the area and clear the intersection when called on but at times, the newcomers have moved to a different location or residents are unwilling to proceed with a report after they've called.

Without these two, nothing else matters.  I would appreciate a response so when I am asked what our elected representative is doing about these two items, I can provide and answer.  Right now, even after spending a couple hours with you, I have no idea.","Good afternoon Kurt,

Thank you for reaching out to our office. Our office is committed to ensuring Denver residents continue to feel safe within the city and within the state. DPD is always actively recruiting and hasn't been lax in prosecuting criminals in Denver. There are multiple operations and initiatives that DPD employs to ensure the appropriate allocation of assets and resources at their disposal and this is usually what many might disagree with. 

CPT Romero Campbell is very vocal in her support for DPD and has never voted against proposals brought forth by DPD during budget hearings. DPD has voiced that they are trying all methods to once again actively recruit but recruitment is just low which is a case across all the major cities across the country.

Denver has ceased welcoming newcomers and is actively working on properly integrating the newcomers in Colorado. Denver is not a sanctuary city neither is Colorado as we still need to adhere to the immigration laws governing the country. If you have more questions, I will be happy to call you to discuss more. Thank you.",Staff1,"Your response is a bit confusing.  It's my understanding that DPD as nothing to do with prosecuting criminals, as you suggest.

Sanctuary State or City is not a legally defined term, you are correct.  However, our governor and mayor have openly encouraged illegal aliens to believe Colorado and Denver are welcoming and a safe place for them.  Illegal Alien is a legally defined term so it's ok to be honest about how they are named.

Thank you for reaching out to our office. After assuming the position of Mayor, Mayor Johnston and his office declared that Denver is experiencing a housing and affordable housing crisis. This prompted his team to conduct research and studies to show the needs of Denverites as well as come up with solutions that could satisfy those needs, They introduced a proposal called the Affordable Denver Fund which involves asking Denver voters to consider a 0.5% increase to the city’s sales tax rate, or 5 cents on a $10 purchase. This would generate $100 million a year to preserve and expand housing affordability, accessibility and attainability for tens of thousands of low- and middle-income Denverites on the 2024 November ballot.

I live in District 4 and have just had the opportunity to speak with many of your other District 4 constituents about the upcoming Beautify Denver cleanup event on Saturday, Sept. 21. An overwhelmingly majority of the people I contacted felt very strongly that the Salvation Army employees and residents at the Tamarac Shelter should participate in the cleanup event.  Their designated area to clean could be between Tamarac and Oneida on both sides of Hampden-the area closest to the shelter.

The facility is a party to the good neighbor agreement and since, for whatever reason, the shelter staff and residents are located in this district, they should have the opportunity to participate in the event to demonstrate their willingness in being contributive community members by cleaning the above-mentioned area.

We would suggest that all residents and staff,  except for those residents who are working on that day, or the most ill or nonambulatory residents, be required to participate in the event. A skeleton staff of Salvation Army employees could be designated to stay at the shelter for those residents who must remain there during the event.

 A crucial attempt at building some goodwill after nine months of opening the shelter seems to be necessary at this time. This could be the inaugural event of a Salvation Army/Tamarac Shelter Adopt-a-Spot campaign.

We are excited for the clean up event the Mayor's office is hosting around the city tomorrow Sept 21st and have spread the word on our social media, newsletter and so on. This event is voluntary and we are encouraging everyone who is able to participate to join us tomorrow morning. 

We will be walking around the Hampden Ave area and other areas of the district that need equal attention and trash picked up. We are striving to keep Denver and District 4 clean and look forward to many more clean up collaborations with the Mayor's office, TSA and other organizations/agencies. Thank you. ",Staff1,,,Homeless
Alex,,alex@email.com,0,2024-09-19,"Hello,
I received a notice of rezoning. Tried to get as much info as I could online but it’s limited and vague. Also, website not working properly.

Please can you elaborate on what you plan to do here in University Hills?

Also, what’s the status of the proposed park on Iliff across from Denver Academy?

That lot has been empty for years. It’s sad.

I’m concerned about this rezoning. 

I live by Yale and Eudora.

Thank you.","Good afternoon Alex,

Thank you for reaching out to our office. I have attached the Near Southeast Area Plan to this thread but a brief overview of the plan; The Near Southeast Area Plan is a part of the Neighborhood Planning Initiative (NPI). NPI is a long-term commitment by the city to ensure every neighborhood in Denver can enjoy the benefits of planning and the implementation of community recommendations and investment priorities. NPI provides a framework for neighborhood planning that is intentional, equitable and measurable, and is flexible enough to allow each plan to address the specific circumstances and concerns of each neighborhood. For more questions, I would encourage you reach out to the citywide and neighborhood planning team via Phone: 720-865-2983 or Email: planningservices@denvergov.org.

Bethesda park is slotted to begin construction in 2026 as per the parks and recreation schedule. The next step for getting this park built is transitioning the Vision Plan(PDF, 31MB) into specific designs that can be used for construction. This will involve reaching back on to community, as it gets into specifics of things like the materials in the play areas, the types of shade structures, etc. This should start up by Fall 2024. Construction of the park is expected to start in early 2026. Please let us know if you have further questions. Thank you.",Staff1,,,"Policy,Parks"
Erin,Hampden & Yosemite,erin@email.com,0,2024-09-20,"I’m a Denver native and longtime resident of Southeast Denver, more specifically Hampden Heights, and I’m incredibly disheartened to see all of the businesses along the Hampden corridor that continue to close. Most recently at Hampden and Yosemite alone, we lost Wells Fargo, Arby’s, and just this week Good Times. I’m hearing that these businesses are leaving because of the unchecked crime in the neighborhood and most of the buildings are sitting unoccupied for months, if not years. Something needs to change. Not only is it inconvenient to have to leave my neighborhood to access fast food or a bank, but it makes our neighborhood much less desirable for new residents and attracts even more crime and homelessness. Please let me know what is being done to address this. We desperately need your assistance as businesses continue to flee at a rapid rate.","Good afternoon Erin,

Thank you for reaching out to our office. Our office is aware of the business exits in our District and we have been with contact with the property managers to get updates on the properties but also updates on potential businesses moving in. These sites are private properties and could be vacant for a number of reasons.

Jenn,Syracuse Way,jenn@email.com,0,2024-09-22," I'm writing to express my concern over the traffic on this road. Every day I see multiple cars speeding down the road, using the turn lane to pass other cars, it easily happens 5 times a day. I live on the corner and see it all the time. The amount of traffic, the speeding and this dangerous new ""driving"" is going to get someone killed. This is a neighborhood, not a highway. Please do some research on our road, we need to make it safer!","Good afternoon Jenn, 

Thank you for reaching out to our office. In order for a research to be conducted on S Syracuse Way, please submit a report to 311 and it will be redirected to DOTI. To get speed trailers parked on this street or at this intersection, you will need to reach out to DPD (3.Dist@denvergov.org) to put in the request. Be sure to share the exact street, intersections and direction the speed trailer should be placed at. Please let me know if you have any more questions. Thank you.",Staff1,"As a follow up to my earlier email, I've been sitting in my backyard for 15 mins, 3 cars have already driving by, passing in the center lane. One was doing it for a few blocks.

Keith,Yale bike lane,keith@email.com,0,2024-09-22,"Thank you for taking the time to meet with staff and community regarding the Yale bicycle lane. As I'd noted, one of the issues created by those bollards is the resulting failure to clear ice/snow and debris, which results in significantly reduced bike lane utility. I would like to call your attention to the bicycle lane introduced on S. Princeton/S Monoco pwky between Quincy and Hampden. Before the bicycle lane was introduced, plows dutifully cleared the vast majority of the street (which in places was two lanes, in others it was somewhat less but drivers tended to behave as if it was two everywhere). Since the introduction of the bicycle lane, the plows are very careful to plow only the auto lane and leave the bicycle lane unplowed. Since there are no bollards (thank goodness) there's no inherent reason for this behavior.  It would be nice if the plows were to return to the older custom of clearing as much of the street as they can, not as little as they can get away with. A secondary, and more minor issue is at the intersection of S. Olive. The bicycle lane is marked with a dotted line until well before the intersection, where it becomes a double solid line. I presume the intent is to force cars to get into the bicycle lane early to prevent cars from accidentally turning into a bicyclist. Having occasionally escorted beginning riders along that stretch,  this seems to work poorly. Either cars ignore it and turn late anyway (and which frankly I think is safer in this case) or they do get into the bicycle lane early, and are frustrated with the slow bicycles and start tailgating (and frightening the cyclists).  I appreciate the desire to reduce the chances of turning into the cyclists, but this doesn't seem to accomplish that. I don't have a better idea (other than to at least reduce the distance and perhaps use a second color to emphasize precisely where we expect the cars to cross into the lane). I thank you, in advance, for forwarding these suggests as appropriate.","Thank you for joining us on the ride and for your insights on your experience using the Yale bike lanes.  If we have any updates on the any actions taken because of the ride I will let you know.

For the Monaco/Princeton if you notice that the lanes are not plowed after a snow fall please report this to 311. This will help the city allocate resources to snow removal resources to bike lanes.

Please also report the intersection at S. Olive to 311 and the area engineers can tak a look at it.",Staff2,,,"Snow Removal,Transit,Vehicle"

Thank you for reaching out to our office and sharing this video with us. Upon reviewing the video, I strongly encourage you to call 911 next time such incidents occur again. Please make reports with the Denver Police and share with them all videos and pictures so it can be entered into the system as evidence.

Sharon,High Line Canal,sharon@email.com,0,2024-09-26,"I had contacted 311 a few times regarding a homeless camp behind my home at 2536 S. Leyden Street.  I believe that the police may have removed them and they are no longer there, but they have left a substantial amount of their belongings and trash/garbage in the canal, including a shopping cart.  It is located down in the canal and is hard to see because of the density of bushes and trees.  I won't walk on the trail any longer as I don't feel safe but have had neighbors tell me it is a mess and should be cleaned up as quickly as possible.  Pease let me know when I can expect it to be cleaned up because as the leaves fall and snow begins, I fear the unsightly mess will be covered up and may be there until next Spring, which is not acceptable.  I hope to hear from you soon! Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  ","Good afternoon Sharon,

I'm an organizer with the campaign for Initiatives 308 and 309, two animal welfare ballot initiatives that will be voted on in Denver this year. There has been a lot of buzz about these measures and we were recently invited to present and answer questions at a meeting of the La Alma-Lincoln Park RNO.

Daniel,,daniel@email.com,0,2024-09-27,"When are you going to stand up to Mayor Mike and demand we have mandatory drug rehabilitation for those who are living on the streets and openly doing drugs? If they don’t want to have rehabilitation then the city should pay for a bus ticket to another state. I’m saddened seeing people actively killing themselves with drugs while the city counsel sits back and allows it. Drug rehabilitation, bus ticket or jail. How many more people need to die?","Good afternoon Daniel. 

Thank you for reaching out to our office. Councilwoman Romero Campbell will continue to advocate for rehabilitation sites for Coloradoans however the city does not have the authority to force people to participate. The city also does not have the authority to forcefully remove people from the state due to drug use. What we can do is continue to report cases of known drug use, areas of frequent drug use and so on to the Police Department so they can investigate and enforce the law. Please let me know if you have further questions. Thank you.",Staff1,"I appreciate you reaching out with a quick response. I’m a bit unclear on some things you have said below. Could you please explain to me why Denver could not use C.R.S. 27-81-111 to force emergency commitment? And then from there have the provider overseeing the patient then pursue C.R.S. 27-81-112 if the person needs more time? Unfortunately, these are not the drugs of the 80s and are extremely difficult to come off of without extreme intervention and rehabilitation. Upon their release is when housing should be offered. Housing without this clearly isn’t working. Thank you in advance for any further information. ","Good afternoon Daniel, 

The Police Department as well as the Street Engagement Team makes first contact with unhoused Coloradoans and these contact approaches could differ. The Police Department is authorized under C.R.S. 27-81-111, to make contact with a person needing emergent attention i.e. overdosing amongst many other emergent situations needing immediate intervention. Simply being unhoused does not qualify someone to be admitted into a facility. If the police makes contact with an unhoused resident who actively has drugs on his/her person, they will be arrested and evaluated to see if further action needs to be taken for their well-being. DPD cannot act on speculation and can only act when people are caught in the act or are experiencing an emergency. 

C.R.S. 27-81-112 is enforced by the courts and again it is at the discretion of the city attorney and their office how to proceed with reports/cases involving unhoused residents. You can reach out to their office to ask what their approach is when dealing with unhoused residents who have been charged with possession of drugs. Keep in mind that the city attorney works within the courts systems and a judge makes the final ruling.

Again, to your previous questions, Councilwoman Romero Campbell will continue to advocate for rehabilitation sites for Coloradoans however the city does not have the authority to force people to participate unless there is an emergency/threat to society. This is true for both housed and unhoused residents who use drugs. The city also does not have the authority to forcefully remove people from the state due to drug use. Further questions regarding C.R.S. 27-81-111 or C.R.S. 27-81-112, please reach out to the appropriate agencies so they can better explain how they enforce these statues. ",Police

Under the old sidewalk ordinance, the homeowners and Excel energy and businesses are responsible for the upkeep of the sidewalk.  The city enforced the ordinance with Excel and the businesses, but the homeowners are exempt because they cannot access this section of sidewalk from their backyards since there are no gates onto Hampden.  Under the new sidewalk ordinance, the city will be responsible for the maintenance of the sidewalk (the businesses will still be responsible to keep the sidewalk clear of weeds and snow).

Mike,Tiffany Plaza,mike@email.com,0,2024-10-01,"I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the vacant businesses in Tiffany Plaza that once served our community. It’s disheartening to see so many empty spaces, especially considering the challenges many businesses face. One idea that could benefit both the community and the plaza is converting the former 24 Hour Fitness into a Denver Rec Center. There's a notable lack of public recreation facilities in the area, with Cook Park being the nearest option, and it tends to get quite crowded. The existing gym facilities and indoor pool at that location could be a great fit for a community center. I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea!","Thank you for reaching out to our office.  Councilwoman Romero Campbell had conversations with the Denver Chamber of Commerce and Denver’s Department of Economic Opportunity (DEDO) advocating to bring businesses to southeast Denver.  The properties are privately owned, and she has reached out to the owners/property managers for any updates and she was assured that they are listed and they are looking for businesses to lease those properties.  

The closed 24 Hour Fitness cannot be converted to a rec center for many reasons; the foundation under the pool is severely damaged and would take extensive repair to get it up to safety and operational standards and the city does not own the property and would not be able to put the kind of money needed for a rec center into a leased building.

Mark,8080 E Dartmouth Ave,mark@email.com,0,2024-10-03,"I am writing this note in frustration from what I am seeing with current city policy or actions.

1.  Trash pick up - it is now becoming routine for one of the trash services to NOT be picked up as scheduled.  This is new and also without notice as to why.  In addition we now pay directly for the service, but actually get less.  This is unacceptable.  Why?  Are monies being taken from Peter to pay Paul?  Our HOA is now in the act as well.  We face potential fines if containers are left out past the date for scheduled pick up.  The city doesn’t do its job so now I potentially get punished for it.

2.  Homeless - A national problem.  From what I can determine Denver has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fix this and is now over budget.  [Does this relate to above?]  So it appears we have damaged the fiscal budget and the problem intended to be fixed is still with us.  This just seems to be questionable leadership and management by all involved.

3.  Public Areas, Parks - I have noticed that the upkeep of public spaces also seems to have been reduced this year.  Some parkways have become overgrown prior to being cut.  I don’t remember this happening to this degree in the past and so it too begs the question - is this a lack of leadership, planning?
A subset of this is on Cornell on the south side of Bible Park.  The cross-over to the parking lot is becoming more of a pedestrian hazard due to the grass on either side of the sidewalk getting just one lawnmower width pass when cut.  The result is becoming more of an eyesore and more importantly it is difficult to see pedestrians cross.  Compounding this is an overgrown tree that when driving east basically blocks all visibility of those crossing from the park.
I recommend that the tree be removed for public safety and next year when the grass is cut along the south end of the park along Cornell to cut ALL of it and not just one pass of the lawnmower.  The cost can't be that prohibitive and it would result in a safer area for drivers and pedestrians.

4.  Bike Paths - I am in total support of bike paths and providing alternative transportation options.  That said, when I see up to 1/3 of a roadway used for a bike path it doesn’t pass the common sense test.  Some paths are as wide as the car lanes.  Near me I see lines painted supposedly for parked cars curbside and then another line for the bike path.  Common sense dictates if riding a bike and a car is parked at the curb you would ride around it and return to your lane.  Making an additional lane in this case is unnecessary.  The result is the loss of more roadway.  When I ride my bike I don’t need the same width as a car, my bike is much smaller in width.

Lastly, in general the topics mentioned above are not new.  What is new is the decline in basic service from this administration.  It concerns me when I see over-runs in budgets; it concerns me when services that have routinely been provided are being cut back; it concerns me when it seems common sense isn’t applied to public policy.  As a taxpayer I support the initiatives above, I don’t support what appears to be poor management or leadership on the part of our city administrators.","Good after Mark,
